## flearn

to run local dev server follow these steps:

1. in client terminal for front end server

```
npm start
```

2. in server terminal for express server

```
npm run server
```

## If the express server is running before the client server, the client server wont allow you to congruently run on port 3000 and there will be CORS errors communicating between ports
